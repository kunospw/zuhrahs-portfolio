# Zuhrah Portfolio

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) portfolio project built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 18.0 or higher) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** or **pnpm** or **bun**

To check if you have Node.js installed, run:
```bash
node --version
```

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone or download this project to your local machine.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd "D:\Dee's archivest\projects\zuhrah-portfolio"
```

Or if you're using a different path:
```bash
cd path/to/zuhrah-portfolio
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install all the required packages and dependencies:

**Using npm:**
```bash
npm install
```

**Using yarn:**
```bash
yarn install
```

**Using pnpm:**
```bash
pnpm install
```

**Using bun:**
```bash
bun install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in `package.json`, including:
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- And other development dependencies

Wait for the installation to complete. This may take a few minutes.

## Running the Project

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

Once the installation is complete, start the development server:

**Using npm:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Using yarn:**
```bash
yarn dev
```

**Using pnpm:**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

**Using bun:**
```bash
bun dev
```

### Step 5: Open in Browser

After the server starts, you should see a message indicating the server is running. Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.
